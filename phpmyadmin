# Changing port of phpmyadmin  #
################################
Original Reference: https://askubuntu.com/questions/896988/change-phpmyadmin-port-from-80-to-another-number

1. Understanding of the default configuration of PhpMyAdmin. By default (within Ubuntu 16.04) PhpMyAdmin is included (and enabled) into the Apache's configuration (for all VirtualHosts!) through this additional configuration file:

/etc/apache2/conf-enabled/phpmyadmin.conf
This file is a symbolic link to the file /etc/apache2/conf-available/phpmyadmin.conf, which is a symbolic link to the file /etc/phpmyadmin/apache.conf, which will be used in the next step.

2. Create new VirtualHost configuration file. Let's call it phpmyadmin.conf and create it by nano (or you can use your favorite text editor):

sudo nano /etc/apache2/sites-available/phpmyadmin.conf
The content of this file should looks like:

Listen 99

<VirtualHost *:99>

        ServerName localhost

        <Directory /usr/share/phpmyadmin>
                AllowOverride None
                Require all granted
        </Directory>

        DocumentRoot /usr/share/phpmyadmin

        Include /etc/phpmyadmin/apache.conf

        ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/phpmyadmin.error.log
        CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/phpmyadmin.access.log combined

</VirtualHost>

Where:

Listen 99 instructs Apache2 to listen on port 99. Like @L.D.James says you can put this directive in /etc/apache2/ports.conf or you can leave it here;

<VirtualHost *:99>...</VirtualHost> defines a VirtualHost which will handle the requests form all interfaces (*) on port :99.

ServerName localhost this directive is optional and can be customised according to your needs. (Usually there have ServerName set on the Server level - in /etc/apache2/apache2.conf);

<Directory /usr/share/phpmyadmin>...</Directory> this directive is optional because the access permissions for /usr/share/ are usually set in /etc/apache2/apache2.conf. But you can add specific rules here, for example you can Set Up Password Authentication;

DocumentRoot /usr/share/phpmyadmin this directive sets /usr/share/phpmyadmin as directory that forms the main document tree visible from the web, for the current VirtualHost;

Include /etc/phpmyadmin/apache.conf this directive includes the default phpMyAdmin's configuration into Apache's configuration. Thus /etc/phpmyadmin/apache.conf will be included only for the current VirtualHost! Instead of this directive you can copy/paste the content of /etc/phpmyadmin/apache.conf in this place.

3. Switch Apache's configuration and restart it.

sudo a2disconf phpmyadmin
sudo a2ensite phpmyadmin
sudo systemctl restart apache2.service
Where:

a2disconf phpmyadmin will disable the default phpMyAdmin's configuration, described in 1.
a2ensite phpmyadmin will enable the new VirtualHost, described in 2.
